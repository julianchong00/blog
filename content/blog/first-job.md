TODO: write post about how I landed my first software engineering job

- Talk about university, how I couldn't land any graduate jobs in the UK, and how I had to move to Australia instead
- Talk about how I didn't really take my career after uni seriously until my 3rd and 4th year (wish I had done more internships in the UK)
  - That's when I did the Microsoft certifications, started to do some side projects
  - I did have some prior professional working experience, but not in the UK
  - In the end, wasn't enough as UK market tough to get entry-level dev job, especially for international student
- After graduation, started to think more about what I needed to do so that I would be able to get a job
  - Started redoing my CV, networking more with people on LinkedIn, learning tech stacks and making side projects that I could point to
  - Over September/October period, applied to more than 50 jobs, some graduate positions/internships, some full time positions, some thru recruiter that contacted me on LinkedIn, some thru Facebook posts lol
    - Strategy for applying, if they had some technology that I was even remotely familiar with, I would put my application in
  - Coincidentally, I managed to get 2 job offers, one which is from a small company which I applied to through their FB advert, the other from a recruiter who connected me with the company
- Interview process (for both offers)
  - 1st one
    - Short call with IT division lead
    - In-person technical interview (about 1.5 hours), short programming task using C#/.NET
    - Received offer shortly after
  - 2nd one
    - Short call with director of tech team
    - 2 hour technical interview with 2 cloud engineers (30 mins background/behavioural, 30 mins technical interview/system design, 1 hr pair programming solving problems with Python/Golang)
    - Received offer shortly after
- Decided to go ahead with 2nd company's offer, as the tech they were using would be more beneficial to my career in the future, as I would be working on microservices/cloud technologies, and that would be more transferrable to other roles, with the rapid growth of cloud in tech.
- Moral of the story, even if you don't think that you are qualified at all for a position, apply anyways! You never know how it will go!
