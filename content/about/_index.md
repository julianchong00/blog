Hi! I'm Julian, a First Class Honour Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton.
The portfolio page of this website will showcase some of the personal projects that I have done.

Aside from that, I will also be semi-consistently making blog posts about my hobbies, tech, and any other topic that I may find interesting.
My skills and experience can be found on the homepage, of which most are to do with application and web development.

I am currently available for full time employment, so reach out to me using the contact form on this website or message me through my socials on the homepage.
