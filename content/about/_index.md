Hi! I'm Julian Chong Zhan Feng, a First Class Honour Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton.
The portfolio page of this website will showcase some of the personal projects that I have done.

Aside from that, I will also be inconsistently making blog posts about my hobbies, tech, and any other topics that I may find interesting.
My skills and experience can be found on the homepage, of which most are to do with application and web development.

I would love to hear about your own projects and experiences, so reach out to me using the contact form on this website or shoot me a message through my socials on the homepage.
